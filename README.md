# Holjjang-Marbles

<p align="justify">This game website is based on the marble game called "Holjjang" played between the two main characters of the show for the fourth game of the Squid Game. The 
basic premise is that each of the players palm a certain number of marbles and guess in turns whether the opponent is holding an odd or even number of marbles in their hand. If 
the player makes a correct guess he can collect the same number of marbles from the opponent as he has palmed in his own hand; if not, he must give the marbles in his palm to the 
opponent. The game continues until one player runs out of marbles, at which point the looser is shot and killed, and his body harvested for organs.</p>

<p align="justify">I did this project since I wanted to work on something that was my own idea, while also improving my flow with the basics of HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
Since I developed this on my own, it can be a bit rough around the edges, something I might return to fix. The website is not responsive at all, since I couldn't come up with a
proper design for a mobile layout. This too is something I want to return to work on, though I haven't got my hopes up in this regard since the layout just does not seem to be the kind which can be adapted for a mobile interface.</p>

<p align="justify">Since I've been learning JavaScript libraries and frameworks like React and Vue, I have come to appreciate their power and convenience in developing web applications. However, I hope to still enjoy creating small websites like these from time-to-time using just plain old HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
